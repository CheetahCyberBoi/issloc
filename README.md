# ISSloc
ISSloc is a command-line, text-user-interfaced, REST-API-based method of finding out the exact location of the ISS (International Space Station) at any given time.
Simply press `Enter` and you are good to go!
### Note
The `delay` keys currently serve no purpose as Ratatui for some reason does not allow for that stuff to update.
